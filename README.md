# ProcessingWork
Programs I have made using Processing 3.5.4, a programming software primarily for graphics use. The SpongebobStory project is a 1.5 minute story made for my Grade 9 Computer Studies culminating. It's graphics imitate those of Spongebob shows. Received 100% on the Spongebob story. 

The Shape_Creator program can be added to any existing program, and it is an interactive shape creator with vertices that can be dragged. It provides the line of code to create the shape and allows for much easier graphics development.
